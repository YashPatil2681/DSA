stack memory is compare to _less that heap memory 
stack memory :-   memory is _static memory allocation
int a = 3
int arr[20]
char ch;



heap memory :-  
memory is _dynamic memory allocation 
new keyword is used to use heap memory 
syntax :- 
new char; // this sentence return address
ex 
char *ch =  new char    //total line is nine bites 
//^ 8    +   ^1     = 9


difference 
_static  : -
syntax :- 
int arr[5]   4 *5  = 20 bites 
low memoery
no need to close or delete memoery externally 

_dynamic :-
syntax :-
int* arr = new int[5]   8 + 4 *5 = 28 bites 
high memory
need to close or delete memory externally using keyword ------(delete)
for single integer :-          delete i
for array          :-          delete []arr
